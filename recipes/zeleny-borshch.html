        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A soup made from broth, sorrel leaves, and vegetables.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked chicken (optional)</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>3 potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>4 cups chopped sorrel or spinach</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp lemon juice (only if using spinach)</li>
            <li>5 hard boiled eggs, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>sour cream, to garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep the vegetables. Chop the onion, peel and chop the carrots and potatoes, slice the sorrel or spinach.</li>
            <li>Bring the broth to a boil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add the onion, carrots and potatoes to the broth. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook, covered, until the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 more minutes.</li>
            <li>While the vegetables are cooking, make the hard boiled eggs, then peel and chop them. You can make the hard boiled eggs in advance or right before serving too.</li>
            <li>When the potatoes are cooked through, add the sorrel or spinach. If you’re using spinach, add the lemon juice as well. Cook 2-5 minutes only.</li>
            <li>If you want to use cooked chicken, add it at the very end too, just for enough time to heat it through. You can use the chicken that you used to make the chicken broth or use any other cooked chicken, cut into bite sized pieces. Chicken is optional.</li>
            <li>Garnish the soup with chopped hard boiled eggs and a dollop of sour cream.</li>
            <li>Serve the soup hot, storing leftovers in the fridge, up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
