        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A "salad" that is more like an actual main course. It's full of vegetables and protein, as well as drenched in mayo. Probably the least healthy salad out there, but delicious.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb of ham</li>
            <li>3 medium potatoes</li>
            <li>15oz sweet peas, drained, or 2 cups thawed frozen peas</li>
            <li>5 boiled eggs</li>
            <li>5 medium-large pickles</li>
            <li>1/3 cup green onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh dill, chopped</li>
            <li>3/4 to 1 cup mayo (to taste)</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In the same pot, boil whole unpeeled potatoes and carrots for about 30 minutes, or until knife pierces them smoothly. Don’t let them get too soft.</li>
            <li>In a separate pot put eggs in salted cold water. Bring to a boil, turn it off and leave it on the same burner with the lid on for 15 minutes (Remember this; it’s how to make the perfect hard-boiled eggs!!) Cool them down in cold water.</li>
            <li> Remove the vegetables and eggs from boiling water and allow them to cool to room temperature prior to chopping. Skin the boiled potatoes and carrots with a small knife. It’s easier to skin the carrots if you make a slit down the length of the carrot and skin in a circle around the carrot. OR you can dice raw carrots and potatoes, boil them together for about 12 mins in unsalted water, remove, rinse with cold water, drain well.</li>
            <li>Chop ham, potatoes, carrots, pickles, and eggs into equal sizes (pea size).</li>
            <li>Mix together potatoes, carrots, pickles, eggs, green onion, dill and mayo. Add more mayo, Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Fold in the peas last so they aren't crushed.</li>
        </ol>
